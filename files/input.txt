What is vimrc?
The vimrc file contains optional runtime configuration settings to initialize Vim when it starts. On Unix based systems, the file is named .vimrc, while on Windows systems it is named _vimrc. :help vimrc

You can customize Vim by putting suitable commands in your vimrc. Here is a very simple example:

" Always wrap long lines:
set wrap
Lines that begin with " are comments and are not read by vim.

Search for file vimrc_example.vim in your Vim files for another example. :help vimrc-intro :help vimrc_example.vim

To customize Vim for editing a specific file, or a specific type of file, you can use modelines, or auto commands, or filetype plugins. :help auto-setting :help filetype
